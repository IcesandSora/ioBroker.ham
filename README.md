# ioBroker Homebridge accessories manager
=================

Use Homebridge plugins in ioBroker or run a global installed Homebridge as ioBroker adapter.
All States from Homebridge will be available in ioBroker too and can also be controlled there.

## Description
This adapter provides two different modes:

If you already use Homebridge (Apple OpenSource SmartHome) to control your devices
then you can use this existing Homebridge installation and start this Homebridge
installation as ioBroker process. In this case the Homebridge server is started by ioBroker.
Additionally all states from Homebridge are available as states in ioBroker and allows to
control from ioBroker.

The second mode (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!!) will allow to just use Homebridge Plugins in iobroker.
More information to come.
